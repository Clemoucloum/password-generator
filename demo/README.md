# Project Update for Password Generator
## Introduction
This repository is a fork of the original [Password Generator](https://github.com/sebastienrousseau/password-generator) by [Sebastien Rousseau](https://github.com/sebastienrousseau). We've created this fork to specifically address an enhancement outlined in [Issue #9](https://github.com/sebastienrousseau/password-generator/issues/9).

## Purpose
The purpose of this update is to create a web-based user demo interface of a password generator.

## Features
#### Customizable Password Length:
Users can specify the exact length of the password, with a specific number of iteration of various length. 

#### Character Inclusion Options:
- Digits: Users can choose to include or exclude digits (0-9) in the password.
- Special Characters: For added security, the option to include special characters (such as +/) can be toggled on or off.

#### Copy functionality
Once a password is generated, it can be easily copied to the clipboard with a single clic.

#### Password strength indicator
The copy button carries a color indicator based on the length of the password, its purpose is to reflect the strength of the password.
