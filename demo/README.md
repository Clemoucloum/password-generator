# Project Update for Password Generator
## Introduction
This repository is a fork of the original [Password Generator](https://github.com/sebastienrousseau/password-generator) by [Sebastien Rousseau](). We've created this fork to specifically address an enhancement outlined in Issue #9.

## Purpose
The purpose of this update is to enhance the user interface and add functionality as requested in the issue. We aim to make the password generator more intuitive and user-friendly by refining the frontend design and interaction model.

## What's New
Demo Directory: We have added at the moment a new directory named demo which includes:
A basic HTML file to demonstrate the changes.
A CSS file that contains new styling to improve visual layout and responsiveness.
