# Project Update for Password Generator
## Introduction
This repository is a fork of the original [Password Generator](https://github.com/sebastienrousseau/password-generator) by [Sebastien Rousseau](https://github.com/sebastienrousseau). We've created this fork to specifically address an enhancement outlined in [Issue #9](https://github.com/sebastienrousseau/password-generator/issues/9).

## Purpose
The purpose of this update is to create a web-based user interface and add functionality as requested in the issue.

## What's New
Demo Directory: We have added at the moment a new directory named demo which includes:
A basic HTML file to demonstrate the changes.
A CSS file that contains new styling to improve visual layout and responsiveness.
